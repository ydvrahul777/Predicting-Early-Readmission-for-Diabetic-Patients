🚑 Predicting Early Readmission for Diabetic Patients

📌 Project Overview
Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a critical issue, impacting both patient health and hospital efficiency. This project aims to predict whether a diabetic patient is at high risk of early readmission, enabling better resource allocation and preventive care.

🎯 Objectives
Identify patients at risk of early readmission within 30 days.
Help hospitals optimize resource utilization and reduce costs.
Improve patient outcomes through timely interventions.
📂 Dataset
The dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing patient records, demographic details, medical history, and hospital admission details.
